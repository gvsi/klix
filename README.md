Klix is a web application developed during StudentHack 2014 that allows a better and more interactive participation during lectures and classes.

#Approach
Klix replicates the use of university clickers, the installation and distribution of which is particularly expensive for universities.
Everyone has a smartphone, a tablet or a laptop during lectures, and everyone has access to an internet connection. Why not save money to university?
We believe that using clickers are a great way of learning, that tries to address the problem of just passively listening to the lecturer for hours, without really applying actively the knowledge that's being absorbed.

#Technology
Klix is a real-time question and answer web app. It uses Node.js with Socket.io framework, Express, AngularJS and MongoDB to store questions and answers.
